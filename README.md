## 📈 Key Insights

From this project, several key insights were identified:

1. **Sales Trend**  
   Sales performance from 2020 to 2023 shows a relatively stagnant trend.  
   More effective marketing and operational strategies are needed to drive year-over-year growth.

2. **Sales Distribution by Province**  
   **West Java** recorded the highest sales with the largest contribution to Kimia Farma's total revenue.  
   This indicates a strong market potential in the region.

3. **Branch Rating vs Transaction Rating**  
   Branches with high ratings do not always have corresponding transaction ratings.  
   Improving service quality and customer experience is essential to enhance overall customer satisfaction.
