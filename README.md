## 📈 Key Insights

The project provides several key insights as follows:

1. **Sales Trend**  
   Sales performance from 2020 to 2023 shows a relatively stagnant trend.  
   More effective marketing and operational strategies are required to increase annual growth.

2. **Sales Distribution by Province**  
   **West Java** records the highest sales contribution to Kimia Farma's total national revenue.  
   This indicates strong market potential in the region.

3. **Branch Rating vs. Transaction Rating**  
   High-rated branches do not always have proportional transaction ratings.  
   Improving service quality and customer experience is necessary to enhance overall satisfaction.
